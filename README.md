# Spotify Artist Radar

*This project is in active development and is subject to change.*

## Current Features
- Creates and populates a playlist with each specified artist's most recent single, album, or feature when you run `main.py` (in the `server` folder).
- Ignores tracks from collections made by "Various Artists", i.e. movie soundtracks.
- Allows the user to select from a list of artists after searching for one (first search result might not always be the artists being referred to).
- If user enters name of an artist that is already on their tracked list, don't add the name again.
- Playlist name, ID, and tracked artists stored in a Firebase database.

## Goals
- Build something for personal use.
- Become fluent in usage of Spotify Web API with Python and spotipy.
- Learn Svelte and Firebase.
- Work through [issues](https://github.com/alansun25/spotify-artist-radar/issues).
